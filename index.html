			Corvids are a key model-system to study animal behaviour and cognition. Still our understanding of the evolution       of vocal complexity and cognitive processes underlying communication is limited. This meeting will bring together       researchers from the fields of animal behaviour, bioacoustics, cognition, computer sciences and conservation to         update on recent advances and develop key future directions.

		A comparative understanding of how particular behavioural and cognitive processes have evolved in distantly related     taxa is key to further understand evolutionary drivers of behaviour. In the field of vocal communication, research      has mostly focussed on birds because of their vocal learning capacity and non-human primates due to their               phylogenetic proximity with humans. Both models are key to understand the evolution of complex communicative systems     . Among birds, corvids (e.g., ravens, crows, jays and magpies) are a key taxonomic group, that have been the most       studied for their cognitive abilities. Corvids occupy a large diversity of environments, and their social systems       can vary in complexity and in the number of social bonds individuals maintain, which, according to the socio            -complexity hypothesis, could influence the vocal complexity of species. Despite more than 40 years of research on      the behaviour and cognition of corvids, their potential value as an alternative model to primates in understanding      the evolution of complex communication has only emerged recently. Corvids have particularly rich non-song               repertoires and are open-ended vocal learners, which means they can acquire new calls throughout their lives, not       only in a specific sensitive period. In few species, vocalisations have been described to be socially learned from      conspecifics, which is linked to cultural variation and some species have been reported to mimic heterospecific         sounds. Several species of corvids can produce complex, individual sets of call repertoires and their calls encode      individual characteristics. Understanding and measuring the various characteristics of vocal complexity in corvid       vocal production as well as perception of signals could be key to further understand the evolution of sociality as      well as complex cognition in different taxa. Further, understanding of vocal communication can also aid conservation     efforts for species of conservation concern, such as the Hawaiian crow or ʻalalā (Corvus hawaiiensis), that is          currently extinct in the wild. For example, by monitoring populations but also providing predator training to           individuals prior to release. In the past, research progress on vocal communication in corvids was insular,             focussing on selected species and topics. In the proposed Scientific Meeting and Special Issue, we aim to synthesize     current knowledge and develop a joint vision for the future direction of research on evolutionary drivers of vocal      complexity and cognitive underpinnings of vocal communication.
